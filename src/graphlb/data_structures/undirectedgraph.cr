  # An undirected graph is a graph that is made up of a set of vertices connected by edges,
  # where the edges have a not direction and weight are associated with the edges.
  #
  # The class provides various methods which can be used to define/modify a simple undirected graph with edge-weight
  # Associated to each edge. Here we are using the adjacency list approach to define a undirected graph which
  # can be modified later as per convience
