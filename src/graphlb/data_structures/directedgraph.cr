# In the module the we have defined the data-structures starting from the simple Node data-structure to a complex tree data-structure
# which will be used in many general graph algorithms to obtain efficient solutions.

# These are Just some of the basic data-structures and more data-structures will be added as we move between different algorithms.

  # A directed graph (or digraph) is a graph that is made up of a set of vertices connected by edges,
  # where the edges have a direction and weight associated with them.
  #
  # The class provides various methods which can be used to define/modify a simple directed graph with edge-weight
  # Associated to each edge. Here we are using the adjacency list approach to define a directed graph which
  # can be modified later as per convience
