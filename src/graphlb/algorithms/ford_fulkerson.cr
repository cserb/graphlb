  # in the graph, to find the maximum possible flow from s to t with following constraints needs to be true:
  #
  # a) Flow on an edge doesnâ€™t exceed the given capacity of the edge.
  #
  # b) Incoming flow is equal to outgoing flow for every vertex except s and t.
  #
  # In ford Fulkerson algorithm An augmenting path is a simple path from source to sink which do not include any
  # cycles and that pass only through positive weighted edges. A residual network graph
  # indicates how much more flow is allowed in each edge in the network graph. If there
  # are no augmenting paths possible from source to sink, then the flow is maximum. The result i.e.
  # the maximum flow will be the total flow out of source node which is also equal to
  # total flow in to the sink node.

    # BFS to go to traverse the graph.
